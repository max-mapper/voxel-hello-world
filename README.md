# Using it as a module

`npm install voxel-hello-world`

```javascript
var game = require('voxel-hello-world')
```

# Get it running on your machine

The first time you set up, you should install the required npm packages:

```
cd voxel-hello-world
npm install
```

Then run the start script:

```
npm start
```

Then point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and have fun!

## Controls

* [W, A, S, D] to move around
* [R] to switch player view
* [Space] to jump
* Double [Space] to fly
* [LEFT Mouse] to destroy a block
* [Control] + [LEFT Mouse] to add a block

## How does this work?

voxel.js modules use [browserify](http://browserify.org) for packaging modules together into game bundles.
This means that every time you change code in your game you have to build a new bundle in order to test it out.
Luckily this is very easy and is automated. When you run the `npm start` script, it runs a local server:
when the browser requests `index.js`, it compiles it serverside and then serves up the compiled version.

The upshot is, as long as you're running the `npm start` script in the background, you can save your changes to
index.js and reload the game to see the new code in action, without having to have a build step in between.
(If you'd like to change the start script, it's contained in the `package.json` file in the root directory.)
